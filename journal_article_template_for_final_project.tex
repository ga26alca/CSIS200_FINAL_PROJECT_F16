First , I imported numpy as np. Then i set variabls. My varible total was equal to 0 and my variable ndays was equal to the number of days in a month. Then , I defined my function as chance. I then wrote my next like as "for i in range (0,ndays):" as my for loop.I named a variable c and equaled c to "np.random.random()". This generates random numbers from 0 to 1. I then wrote an if statement , saying $" if c . 0.0 and c <= 0.20 chance_rain = True"$ The c , or random numbers , has to be either greater that 0 and less than or equal to 0.20 in order for it to be True. The true just means there is a chance of rain. My next line says$ "if chance_rain == True: total += 1"$ .This line means if the chance of rain is real , or True , then we add 1 to our total. On my next line, i wrote$ " elif c=0.20 and c<= 1.0: chance_rain = False"$. This line means if the variable c appears to be greater than 0.20 and less that or equal to 1.0 , then it is false , or it doesnt rain that day.
	I then return the total. My next line states $ print  "0.20f"(percent) (chance())$. This means to print out the percentage that i get from the chance to 2 decimal points. I then got 0.00 as my answer.
